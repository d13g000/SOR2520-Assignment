# Dependent variable: cognitive_function_scores
# Factors: education (categorical) and income_level (categorical)
# Covariates: systolic_blood_pressure, cholesterol_levels, blood_glucose_levels


# Step 1: Create boxplots of levels in factor variables
# Visualize relationships between cognitive function scores and factors

# Boxplot for education levels
ggplot(data, aes(x = education, y = cognitive_function_scores)) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill = "skyblue") +

  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightgreen") +
  ggtitle("Boxplot: Income Levels vs Cognitive Function Scores") +

# Step 2: Create scatterplot matrix of cognitive function vs covariates
# Visualize relationships between cognitive function scores and covariates

               "cholesterol_levels", "blood_glucose_levels")],

# Step 3: Analyze multicollinearity
## 3.1 Spearman correlation of factors and covariates

# Spearman Hypothesis:
# Null: There is no correlation between covariates and factors.
# Alternative: There is significant correlation between at least one pair of variables.

correlation_matrix <- cor(data[, c("systolic_blood_pressure", "cholesterol_levels",

## 3.2 Condition indices and variance proportions
# Fit initial model for multicollinearity diagnostics

# Check condition indices and variance proportions

## 3.3 Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs)

# VIF Hypothesis:
# Null hypothesis: VIF is within acceptable range (VIF < 5-10).
# Alternative: High VIF indicates multicollinearity.

vif_values <- vif(ancova_model)

# Step 4: Run ANCOVA

# ANCOVA Hypothesis:
# Null: There is no difference in cognitive function scores between factor levels after accounting for covariates.
# Alternative: At least one factor level has a significant effect on cognitive function scores after accounting for covariates.

anova(ancova_model)   # View ANOVA table for the model


# Step 5: Analyze independence of residuals using Durbin-Watson test

# Durbin-Watson Hypothesis:
# Null: Residuals are independent (no autocorrelation).
# Alternative: Residuals are autocorrelated.

# High leverage points can influence the model significantly.

# Cook's distance identifies influential points. Threshold is 4/n, where n is the number of observations.

# Step 7: Check distribution of residuals
## 7.1 Shapiro-Wilk test

# Shapiro-Wilk Hypothesis:
# Null: Residuals are normally distributed.
# Alternative: Residuals are not normally distributed.

## 7.2 Histogram of residuals

## 7.3 Q-Q plot of residuals

qqline(residuals(ancova_model), col = "red")


# Step 8: Check homoscedasticity
## 8.1 Scatterplot of fitted vs residual values

# Homoscedasticity Hypothesis:
# Null: Homoscedasticity (constant variance of residuals).
# Alternative: Heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance of residuals).
